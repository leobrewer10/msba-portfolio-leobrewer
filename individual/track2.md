One team reccomendation I chose to pick is a reward system for refferals. This could be implemented by giving the customers maybe a credit or discount on future payments for every customer they bring in. This is good becasue it will passively help with the less important task of finding new customers whilst simultaneously lead to more refferals which have been shown to lower the churn percentage when 3 or more refferals are made. The baseline customer churn from our data was 27% however in the EDA we found that customers with 3+ refferals only churned 9.8% of the time. If we could see a higher percentage of customers with 3 or more refferals then I would expect 27% churn rate to decrease by a lot. By measuring refferals with the new reward system in place we would hopefully reduce churn. However it is worth noting that if customers are only using the refferals for the rewards then the figures of 3+ refferal churn could change becuase people are reffering for a different reason with a motivation this time.
