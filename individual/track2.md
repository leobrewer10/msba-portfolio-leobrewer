One team reccomendation I chose to pick is a reward system for refferals. This could be implemented by giving the customers maybe a credit or discount on future payments for every customer they bring in. This is good becasue it will passively help with the less important task of finding new customers whilst simultaneously lead to more refferals which have been shown to lower the churn percentage when 3 or more refferals are made.
