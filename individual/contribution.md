I contributed by helping with the early stage of the EDA and was definitely advocating for compiling some of our variables into one larger variable in the fature engineering part of the project, specifically number_of_services because this helped consolidate a few variables that had little effect on their own because of how specific they were, together they could create a more effective varibale for our model. I think one thing I learnt was to really make sure that we had decided what to do with null and 0 values and understand the context of these missing or confusing values to help us more down the line.
