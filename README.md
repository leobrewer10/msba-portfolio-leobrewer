Our business problem revolves around customer churn. This is an issue for TruSource because losing customers is bad for business. There is a large focus on finding out how we can retain current customers as this is more effective than finding new ones. 
We found 3 key results 
- when customers make more than 3 referals they are much less likely to churn
- when married with dependents, they churn at a muhc lower rate
- the first month sees higher than average churn rates


We run the code by copying the file from the repository, then opening it in colab via the feature provided. Then you are able to run the cells locally by clicking the play button.
The potential limitations of this that you should know is the model is very specific to our dataset and as a result this means it might not work when used on something else. We chose specific variables, created new ones as well, so this is unique to our project.
