Our business problem revolves around customer churn. This is an issue for TruSource because losing customers is bad for business. There is a large focus on finding out how we can retain current customers as this is more effective than finding new ones. 
We found 3 key results 
- when customers make more than 3 referals they are much less likely to churn
- when married with dependents, they churn at a muhc lower rate
- the first month sees higher than average churn rates
